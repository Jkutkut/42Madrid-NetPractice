# Level 1:

## Goal 1:
- Second value of Client A's IP is invalid. Having in mind the Mask and B's IP, the correct value is 95 (93 given).
- Ip is invalid. My IP can not be greater than 255 (in reality even less than 255).
- If I use the IP 104.93.23.13 (the next with client B)

## Goal 2:
- Client D's IP is invalid. The Mask is 255.255.0.0 but the original IP is 211.190 instead of 211.191.
- Furthermore, the 3th value is set to 375 but that's not valid. If you enter 167 or any other in the last 2 values, it should work.
